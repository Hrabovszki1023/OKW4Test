# OKW4TEST

OKW4Test is a converter that generates JUnit test cases in OpenKeyWord notation from 4Test test cases. The combination of the two test tools 4Test and OKW leads to a dramatic reduction in the creation and maintenance of test cases. 

## 4Test
4Test offers you a simple Gherkin-based model to design your tests in the most efficient way. The tests are generated from the model. This minimizes the effort to create and maintain test cases.

## OpenKeyword
Openkeyword is a keyword-framework and provides well-defined keywords for elementary user activities on the GUI. 
Besides the elementary keywords Openkeyword also offers GUI adapters for standard WEB and Selenium. This makes immediate automation possible. 
Other automation tools can be easily integrated if they can be addressed via an API from JAVA.
